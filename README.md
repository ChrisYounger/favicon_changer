# Browser Icon Changer (favicon)

An app to change the Splunk browser icon. When you have many tabs open, spread across to different Splunk environments (e.g. Prod vs non-Prod), this makes it easier to differentiate what each tab is for. You may also want to differentiate dedicated Splunk management instances (e.g. monitoring console or cluster master) from your main search head/s.

WARNING: Changing the browser icon will cause Splunk to periodically show a "File integrity" messages to all Administrators. These messages can be safely ignored for `favicon.ico`. For this reason, changing the browser icon is not recommended for production environments.

* Splunk upgrades will restore the original icon.
* Compatible with search head clusters.
* This app is only visible to Administrators and the rest API requires `admin_all_objects` capability.
